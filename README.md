# Introduction
Hello, I'm [@qyyvv](https://github.com/qyyvv), a 16 year old developer living in the United States.

My interests in programming range from low-level C code to high-level Python-based applications as well as web development with JavaScript. Hope to contribute to open source.

# C/C++
Most of my C++ code is related to scientific/algorithmic computation. Though I don't often code at a systems level, I have some experience with the basics of
operating systems and memory management in C, though not much of these are uploaded as repositories.

# Python
I primarily use Python in development for building applications and software that work with external APIs or libraries. The bulk of the software I host on GitHub
is coded in Python. I'm also interested in machine learning and neural networks, particularly with `keras` and `scipy`.

# JavaScript
I've primarily used JavaScript in my projects to makeup for Python's shortcomings in web development. I've built web applications and "bots" specifically
with the `discord.js` API, and I hope to expand this knowledge to more advanced frameworks in the future.
